<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
  My teaching philosophy focuses on practical learning and active engagement, rooted in principles of design thinking, diversity, and integrity. 
  I aim to foster an inclusive space where students can apply theory to real-world challenges. 
  I am inspired by <a href="https://cmccomb.com/">Chris McComb</a>'s metacognitive reflection and  <a href="https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a>'s caring and student wellness approaches teaching philosophy. 
  I am aspired to empower students in my classes with any resources available to me, including through the use of AI technology.

<h2>General Policy on AI Usage in My Classroom</h2>
We are committed to fostering an environment where the responsible use of generative AI tools can enhance both learning and creativity. 
Here are the general guidelines to help you in integrating AI responsibly into the coursework:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Freedom to Use AI</strong>: You are encouraged to use AI tools as you see fit. This trust is based on your demonstrated responsibility and initiative as learners adept at managing advanced technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical and Responsible Use</strong>: It is essential to ensure that AI-generated content is accurate, unbiased, and respectful. You are expected to scrutinize the AI output for any issues such as plagiarism, bias, or inappropriate content and rectify these problems before submission.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency and Metacognitive Reflection in Usage</strong>: Every piece of work that includes AI assistance must have an accompanying <a href="/ai-usage-and-reflection-form.docx">AI Usage and Reflection Form</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Seek Consent for Sensitive Data</strong>: Always secure consent before entering private, sensitive, or copyrighted information into any AI system, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and respect for privacy.</li>
  <li><strong>Support and Resources</strong>: If you have any uncertainties about this policy or require assistance with AI tools, please do not hesitate to contact the teaching team. We are here to support your academic journey and ensure you can use AI effectively and ethically.</li>
</ul>
  
These guidelines are intended to enable you to contribute to a learning environment that values integrity, innovation, and critical examination. These practices not only enhance our academic endeavors but also prepare us for the ethical use of technology. 
I look forward to seeing how you creatively and responsibly integrate AI into your work, and I am always available to discuss any aspect of AI usage in your projects.
