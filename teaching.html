<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
  My teaching philosophy focuses on practical learning and active engagement, rooted in principles of design thinking, diversity, and integrity. I aim to foster an inclusive space where students can apply theory to real-world challenges. I am inspired by <a href="https://cmccomb.com/">Chris McComb</a>'s meta-cognition and  <a href="https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a>'s caring and student wellness approaches teaching philosophy. I am aspired to empower students in my classes.
