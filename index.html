I am PhD student in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/) with the [College of Engineering](https://engineering.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). 
I work in the [CMU Safe AI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/) and am supervised by [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). 
Our groupâ€™s work focuses on the safe deployment of intelligent systems, which include autonomous vehicle technologies. 
Much of [my work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ) deals with simulations of catastrophic rare events. Specifically, I combine machine learning, statistical models, and rare-event theories to 
design more efficient simulation methodologies to assess the performance of intelligent agents under rare-event settings with sufficient confidence to make better-informed decisions.
