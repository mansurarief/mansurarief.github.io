<p>I am a third-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a> 
of the <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/">College of Engineering</a> 
at  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
I received my bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/industrial-and-systems-engineering/">Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, ITS</a> 
and master's degree from the <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/">Industrial and Operations Engineering Department, University of Michigan</a>. 
</p> 
<p>
I work in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU Safe AI Lab</a> 
supervised by <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Prof. Ding Zhao</a>. 
Our groupâ€™s work focuses on the safe deployment of intelligent systems.
Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> combines machine learning 
and rare-event theories to efficiently simulate catastrophic rare events. 
The applications of this line of work include the accelerated safety testing of autonomous vehicles.
