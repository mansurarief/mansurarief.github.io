<p>I am a postdoc at <a href="https://sisl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab (SISL)</a> working with <a href="https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from the <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a> 
at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2023, working with <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Prof. Ding Zhao</a>. 
in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU Safe AI Lab</a>. I received my bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/industrial-and-systems-engineering/">Industrial and Systems Engineering Department</a> 
at <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/">ITS</a> and master's degree from the <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/">Industrial and Operations Engineering Department</a> 
at the <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. 
</p> 

<p>Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> combines machine learning 
and rare-event theories to efficiently simulate rare catastrophic events. The applications of this line of work include the accelerated safety testing of autonomous vehicles. 
Currently, I am working on a few AI for safety and sustainability projects, which mostly combine these efficient simulation framework with planning and decision-making algorithms. 
Here is the <a href="/assets/pdf/vita-mansur-m-arief-202306.pdf">link to my CV</a>. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate or have any questions.
