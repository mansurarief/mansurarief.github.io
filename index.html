<p>I am a full-time research engineer at the <a href="https://sisl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab (SISL)</a> advised by <a href="https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a> with a joint appointment at <a href="https://mineralx.stanford.edu/">Mineral-X</a> working with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jef-caers">Jef Caers</a>. I am also <a href="https://www.ulbi.ac.id/p/international-adjunct-professor-2025_24.html">appointed as an Adjunct Professor</a> at <a href="https://www.ulbi.ac.id//">ULBI</a>, Indonesia, to help accelerate innovation in logistics and supply chains through the responsible use of AI and automation. I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by Ding Zhao in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Safe AI</a> lab. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering at <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/">ITS, Indonesia</a> and my Master's degree in Industrial and Operations Engineering at the <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">My research</a> primarily integrates machine learning, optimization, and sample-efficient simulation methods to assist with scalable decision-making under catastrophic failure risks. This approach is particularly useful for <a href="https://vandvaiproducts.github.io/">V&V of AI-based systems</a> and earth resources supply chain management. For a full list of publications, see the <a href="publications">publication page</a>.</p>

<p>I also enjoy <a href="teaching">teaching</a> and mentoring students, as well as volunteering on various occasions. I have co-instructed courses to help students structure their ideas and plans for <a href="https://analyticsprojects.id/">data-driven analytics projects</a>. I work with students (graduate, undergraduate, and high school) in various research mentorship capacities. I also serve as a <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/ITT-7819-2023">reviewer and program committee member</a> for various journals and conferences in transportation, AI, and sustainability fields. Additionally, I am a Guest Editor for <a href="https://journal.oscm-forum.org/ai-cps-special-issue/">the Special Issue on AI, CPS, and DM in OSCM</a>.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be surrounded by great mentors, collaborators, students, and colleagues on various occasions and am constantly learning from them every single day. I am open to exploring potential collaborations. Here is the link to <a href="/assets/pdf/vita-mansur-m-arief.pdf">my CV</a> for further information.</p>
