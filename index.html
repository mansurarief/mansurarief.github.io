<p>I am a postdoc at <a href="https://sisl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab (SISL)</a> working with <a href="https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/">Mykel Kochenderfer</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from Mechanical Engineering
at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a> in 2023, advised by <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Ding Zhao</a>. In the past, I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/industrial-and-systems-engineering/">IE ITS, in Indonesia</a> 
and master's degree from <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/">IOE at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. 
</p> 

<p>Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> combines machine learning 
and rare-event theories to efficiently simulate rare catastrophic events. The applications of this line of work include the accelerated safety testing of autonomous vehicles. 
Currently, I am working on a few AI for safety and sustainability projects, which merge efficient simulation framework with optimization and decision-making algorithms. 
Feel free to reach out for potential collaboration. Here is the <a href="/assets/pdf/vita-mansur-m-arief.pdf">link to my CV</a>.
