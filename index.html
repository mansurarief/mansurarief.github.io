<p>I am PhD student in the <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a> 
with the <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/">College of Engineering</a> 
at  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
I work in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU Safe AI Lab</a> 
supervised by <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Prof. Ding Zhao</a>. 
Our groupâ€™s work focuses on the safe deployment of intelligent systems.
Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> combines machine learning 
and rare-event theories to efficiently simulate catastrophic rare events, 
which include unsafe driving scenarios involving autonomous vehicles.
