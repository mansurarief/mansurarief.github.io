<p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a>, 
<a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/">College of Engineering</a> at  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
I received my bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/industrial-and-systems-engineering/">Industrial and Systems Engineering Department</a> 
at <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/">ITS</a> and master's degree from the <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/">Industrial and Operations Engineering Department</a> 
at the <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. 
</p> 

<p>I work in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU Safe AI Lab</a> supervised by <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Prof. Ding Zhao</a>. 
Our groupâ€™s work focuses on the safe deployment of intelligent systems. Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> combines machine learning 
and rare-event theories to efficiently simulate catastrophic rare events. The applications of this line of work include the accelerated safety testing of autonomous vehicles. 
</p> 

<p>Currently, I am serving as the President of <a href="https://thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/indonesian-students-at-cmu">the Indonesian Student Association at CMU (ISCMU)</a>. 
    Here is the <a href="/assets/pdf/vita-mansur-m-arief-052021.pdf">link to my CV</a>.
