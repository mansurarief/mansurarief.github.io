I am PhD student in the <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a> 
with the <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/">College of Engineering</a> 
at  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
I work in the <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU Safe AI Lab</a> 
and am supervised by <a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">Prof. Ding Zhao</a>. 
Our groupâ€™s work focuses on the safe deployment of intelligent systems, which include autonomous vehicles. 
Much of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbJC_9kAAAAJ">my work</a> deals with simulations of catastrophic rare events. 
Specifically, I combine machine learning, statistical models, and rare-event theories to 
design more efficient simulation methodologies to assess the performance of intelligent agents under rare-event settings. 
I hope with better performance evaluation tools, we can make better-informed decisions regarding these emerging technologies.
