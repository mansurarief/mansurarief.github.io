### Trustworthy AI: Ensuring Safety in Cyber-Physical Systems

Achieving an AI-driven CPS system that is not only capable and efficient but also certifiably safe and trustworthy requires adhering to the NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI[^1], 
which includes aspects such as validity and reliability, safety, security and resilience, accountability and transparency, and fairness. To this end, my research[^2] emphasizes the need for AI systems to be resilient against diverse environmental conditions, secure against adversarial threats, and transparent to the developers and intended users, 
particularly through three research thrusts:

1. **Trustworthiness-embedded CPS Development**: The focus is to embed trustworthiness in every CPS development phase, from initial project scoping and design through to post-deployment. For instance, we ensure CPS sensors provide comprehensive environmental awareness thereby enhancing safety not only for the agent but also for all surrounding users[^3]. We also incorporate fairness during the training of classification modules by emphasizing equal error reduction across all object classes[^4] and during testing and deployment by adopting an adaptable, risk-aware approach that carefully considers common and rare safety-critical scenarios to ensure safety for all[^5].
2. **Safe Online Adaptation**: The goal is to implement robust mechanisms for continuous out-of-model-scope detections and retraining, alleviating the impracticality of covering every possible deployment scenario during the development phase. To this end, I developed a point-cloud annotation tool that allows operators to more easily identify rare objects and emphasize them in the training process[^6]. I have also combined zero-shot classification for novel instances with data augmentation for efficient model retraining[^7].
3. **Certifiable Validation**: Finally, to improve the efficiency of validating AI algorithms with already good performance (e.g., millions of miles of driving data may not sufficiently prove superior safety over humans due to the rarity of safety-critical incidents), I develop rare-event simulation techniques combining neural networks and importance sampling[^8] [^9] and analytically prove their theoretical guarantees[^10].
   
Looking ahead, the journey of integrating AI into CPS is both thrilling and challenging. My upcoming research represents bold strides into new territories, shaped by the dynamic nature of AI development. These endeavors promise to revolutionize safety, efficiency, and innovation in cyber-physical systems, marking an exciting applications-driven future for AI. I will continue to pursue the following research directions:

1. **Safety Certification** throughout its lifecycle. I plan to extend the rare-event simulation to partially observable, multimodal, and mixed-autonomy AI applications and integrate multi-fidelity approaches[^11] to improve real-world testing efficiency.
2. **Multimodal CPS** for expert assistants in critical tasks, such as dental work, surgery, or lab testing. My collaboration to push this direction forward will include colleagues from leading research institutions.
3. **AI for Safety and Sustainability** applications which directly address the urgent need to certify ADAS, autonomous robots, and UAVs, as well as to safely and more efficiently perform mining and exploration of critical minerals and renewable energy using AI and unmanned systems. I am closely collaborating with Stanford MineralX and various mining, energy and exploration companies aiming to decarbonize the industry.
