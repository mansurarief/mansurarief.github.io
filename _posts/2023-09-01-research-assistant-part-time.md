# Research Assistantship Opportunity (Indonesian residents only)

Are you passionate about the potential of AI/ML in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains in Indonesian context? Do you have a knack for coding in Python or Julia, are eager to contribute to cutting-edge research, and increase your publications at top-tier conferences/journals? If so, we invite you to join our team as a Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant.


**Position:** Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant (Indonesian residents only)

**Hours Commitment:** 6-12 hours per week (part time)

**Compensation:**
- Monthly stipend of IDR 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 (Please note that this is meant as a part-time stipend and not a full-time salary)
- Bonus stipend per accepted publication at top-tier conferences/journals
- Shared authorship on publications
- Flexible work hours (but meetings may be scheduled outside of normal working hours due to time zone differences)
- Potential funding support for graduate school applications or tests (e.g., GRE, TOEFL, IELTS)
- Potential recommendation letter for graduate school applications

**Role Responsibilities:**

As a Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant, your primary responsibilities will include:

1. **Meetings:** Attend up to 3 hours of weekly meetings with a few research teams to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. Our research teams may reside in Indonesia or other countries so please be flexible with your meeting availability and time zone differences.

2. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** Write Python/Julia code to prepare and preprocess training data, ensuring it is clean, structured, and ready for model training.

3. **Model Training:** Develop and train machine learning models using state-of-the-art techniques and libraries to address problems in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of trained models through rigorous evaluation, including metrics and statistical analysis.

5. **POMDP Sequential Decision Making:** Build POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) sequential decision-making models in POMDP.jl, a Julia-based framework.

6. **Problem Solving:** Collaborate and model real-world problems in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains to gain insights about the problems and the potential of AI/ML methods to solve them.

7. **Writing:** Collaborate on writing a research paper, cleaning up codes to submit to Github repositories, and paper submissions to top-tier conferences/journals.


**Eligibility:**
- Currently residing in Indonesia
- Enrolled in or completed a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Management Sciences, Operations Research, or a related field from a reputable university.

**Qualifications:**
- Strong academic record with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0.
- Proficiency in computer programming (Python and/or Julia preferred).
- Strong modeling, problem-solving, and analytical skills.
- Passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning with a strong desire to learn and grow.
- Ability to work independently and as part of a research team.
- Ability to communicate effectively in written Bahasa Indonesia and English.

**Preferred:**
- Previous coursework or project experience in machine learning, data science, or related fields.
- Familiarity with POMDP modeling and Julia.
- Experience with healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, or supply chain projects.
- Open-source contributions or related coding projects.
