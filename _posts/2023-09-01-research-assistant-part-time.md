# Research Assistantship Opportunity

**Position:** Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant

**Hours Commitment:** 5-10 hours per week (part time)

Are you passionate about the potential of AI/ML in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains? Do you have a knack for coding in Python or Julia, are eager to contribute to cutting-edge research, and increase your publications at top-tier conferences/journals? If so, we invite you to join our team as a Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant.

**Role Responsibilities:**

As a Part-time AI/ML Research Assistant, your primary responsibilities will include:

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** Write Python/Julia code to prepare and preprocess training data, ensuring it is clean, structured, and ready for model training.

2. **Model Training:** Develop and train machine learning models using state-of-the-art techniques and libraries to address problems in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of trained models through rigorous evaluation, including metrics and statistical analysis.

4. **POMDP Sequential Decision Making:** Build POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) sequential decision-making models in POMDP.jl, a Julia-based framework.

5. **Problem Solving:** Collaborate and model real-world problems in healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains to gain insights about the problems and the potential of AI/ML methods to solve them.

**Qualifications:**

- Enrolled in or completed a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field from a reputable university.
- Proficiency in Python and/or Julia programming.
- Passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning with a strong desire to learn and grow.
- Ability to work independently and as part of a research team.
- Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.

**Recommended:**
- Previous coursework or project experience in machine learning, data science, or related fields.
- Familiarity with POMDP modeling and Julia.
- Experience with healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, or supply chain projects.
- Open-source contributions or related coding projects.

**How to Apply:**

If you're excited about the prospect of contributing to cutting-edge research in AI/ML and solving real-world problems, please submit your *resume* and *a brief cover letter* outlining your relevant experience and interest in the role to *mansur.arief@stanford.edu*.

Join us in making a meaningful impact in the fields of healthcare, sustainability, intelligent autonomy, and supply chains through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
