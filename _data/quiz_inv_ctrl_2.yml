  question: "Spare-part SKU#123 is a critical component for electricity distribution (with a stockout cost of 10 billion Rupiah). It has an order lead time of 60 days (it is a customized part) and a demand of about 1 unit every 2 weeks. The inventory manager is considering decreasing the reorder point to reduce inventory holding cost, since the item is expensive, hard to store, and has a low demand. What could the manager do to still do this without increasing the risk of stockout?"
  options:
    - text: "Nothing, decreasing the reorder point will increase the risk of stockout."
      note: ""
    - text: "Work with all the ULPs to reduce the stockout cost."
