  question: "Suppose the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sets a requirement that the false negative rate of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception should be less than 0.00001. The current rate is 0.01. To achieve this, the company would need to install additional redundant sensors and an ensemble of robust detectors and classifiers, which would increase the cost by $20,000 per vehicle. The company decides to implement these changes despite the high cost, in order to meet the NHTSA requirement. Which principle of HAZOP is the company adhering to in this scenario?"
