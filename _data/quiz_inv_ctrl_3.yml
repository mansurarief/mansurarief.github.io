  question: "Why might the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model be insufficient for optimizing spare parts inventory?"
  options:
    - text: "It assumes constant demand"
      note: "Correct! The EOQ model assumes constant demand, which is often not the case for spare parts."
    - text: "It doesn't consider lead time"
      note: ""
    - text: "It's too complex to implement"

  question: "What is the main advantage of using stochastic optimization for spare parts inventory control?"
  options:
    - text: "It's always faster than other methods"
      note: ""
    - text: "It considers uncertainty in demand and lead time"
      note: "Correct! Stochastic optimization accounts for variability in demand and lead time, which is crucial for spare parts."

  question: "In the context of spare parts inventory, what does 'service level' primarily refer to?"
  options:
    - text: "The quality of customer service"
      note: ""
    - text: "The probability of not experiencing a stockout"
      note: "Correct! Service level typically refers to the probability of meeting demand from stock."

  question: "A company is struggling with frequent stockouts of a critical spare part despite using an EOQ model. What could be a potential reason for this?"
  options:
    - text: "The EOQ model is always incorrect"
      note: ""
    - text: "The demand for the part is likely intermittent or highly variable"
      note: "Correct! EOQ assumes constant demand, which may not hold for spare parts with intermittent or variable demand."
    - text: "The company is ordering too frequently"
      note: ""
    - text: "The service level is set too high"

  question: "What is the main benefit of using a centralized inventory control strategy for spare parts?"
  options:
    - text: "It always reduces transportation costs"
      note: ""
    - text: "It eliminates the need for forecasting"
      note: ""
    - text: "It can help reduce overall inventory costs"
